    Chapter 2: The Mysterious Rival

You decide to approach Master Shinobi with determination, introducing yourself 
and expressing your eagerness to embark on your cosmic ninja journey. 
Master Shinobi, with a wise smile, listens to your aspirations and welcomes you 
with a nod of approval. As you converse, Master Shinobi mentions a 
fellow student, Hiro, who has been a rising star in the academy. He suggests 
that Hiro might make a suitable rival to push you to greater heights. 
Master Shinobi arranges for you to meet Hiro in the academy's courtyard, where 
you'll have an opportunity to challenge each other to a friendly duel.
When you arrive at the courtyard, Hiro is already there, his laser ninja-weapon 
at the ready. The duel begins, and Hiro proves to be a formidable opponent. 
This encounter becomes a defining moment in your journey, setting the stage for 
a rivalry that will shape your path as a cosmic ninja.""")

    Chapter 2: The Forbidden Scrolls
    
You decide to blend into the crowd and observe the various training sessions, 
contemplating how you'll navigate this new world. While wandering through the 
academy's extensive archives, you stumble upon a section marked 
"Forbidden Scrolls." The scrolls are encased in a holographic shield, clearly 
meant to keep curious eyes away. As you ponder the significance of these 
scrolls, an instructor approaches. She warns you that those scrolls contain 
ancient and powerful cosmic ninja techniques, and they are strictly off-limits 
to all students. The instructor tells you that such knowledge can be dangerous 
in the wrong hands and asks if you've seen anyone tampering with them.""")
