entities merged into it, begins to wreak havoc on the galaxy. The once peaceful

Starshard's uncontrollable power. Chaos reigns, and the galaxy falls into 
darkness and despair. Your legacy is one of tragedy and devastation, a grim 
reminder of the consequences of your actions. The galaxy will never forget the
day when two cosmic ninjas succumbed to the allure of the Starshard, and the 
cosmic order was forever altered.""")

    Chapter 5: The Cosmic Divide

Your unwavering support for the council's decision to secure and study the 
Starshard under the academy's guidance sets a series of events into motion that
will forever alter the cosmic ninja world. In the beginning, the academy's 
research into the Starshard proceeds cautiously and methodically. Cosmic ninjas
work tirelessly to unlock the secrets of the artifact while ensuring its power 
remains contained and controlled. However, as time passes, disagreements within
the academy council intensify. Some members believe that the Starshard's cosmic
powers should be harnessed to establish dominance over the galaxy, seeing it 
as a means to ensure peace and prosperity under their rule. Others staunchly 
oppose any attempt to use the Starshard, fearing the catastrophic consequences
that could result from its unchecked power. The disagreements escalate into a 
bitter feud, dividing the cosmic ninja order into two factions. Civil war 
erupts, and for centuries, the two sides wage a relentless battle for control 
of the Starshard. One side seeks to use its cosmic powers to crush the rest of
the galaxy and establish themselves as its sole rulers, while the other side 
fights tirelessly to never use the shard and protect it from all who wish to 
harness its power. The galaxy is torn apart by the conflict, and countless 
lives are lost in the struggle for dominance. The Starshard becomes a symbol 
of power and division, with neither side willing to compromise or back down.
As the centuries pass, the cosmic ninja world remains locked in a seemingly 
endless cycle of war, with no end in sight. The fate of the galaxy hangs in the
balance, and the Starshard's potential for both salvation and destruction 
continues to shape the destiny of all who seek its cosmic power.""")
