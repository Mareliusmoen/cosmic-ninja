    Chapter 1: The Galactic Academy

In a galaxy far beyond our own, where stars burned brighter than the sharpest 
blades and cosmic winds whispered secrets of ancient arts, you find yourself at 
the threshold of the Galactic Ninja Academy. The journey to becoming a cosmic 
ninja begins here. The academy stands as a testament to the celestial marvels 
of the cosmos. Vast, spiraling corridors stretch into the distance, adorned 
with holographic constellations. The students, a diverse group from across the 
galaxy, move with grace and purpose. Some practice their laser ninja-weapon 
skills, while others engage in intense combat simulations. The academy is alive 
with the energy of ambition.
Master Shinobi, the headmaster of the academy, is a figure of great respect and 
authority. His eyes have witnessed countless cosmic warriors rise and fall. 
His wisdom is legendary, and his stern but fair guidance is sought after by all.""")
